  abstract = {Diatom communities preserved in sediment samples are valuable indicators for understanding the past and present dynamics of phytoplankton communities, and their response to environmental changes. These studies are traditionally achieved by counting methods using optical microscopy, a time-consuming process that requires taxonomic expertise. With the advent of automated image acquisition workflows, large image datasets can now be acquired, but raise the need for efficient preprocessing methods. Detecting diatom frustules on microscope images is a challenge due to their low relief, diverse shapes, and tendency to aggregate, which prevent the use of traditional thresholding techniques. Deep learning algorithms have the potential to resolve these challenges, more particularly for the task of object detection. Here we explore the use of a Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) model to detect siliceous biominerals, including diatoms, in microscope images of a sediment trap series from the Mediterranean Sea. Our workflow demonstrates promising results, achieving a precision score of 0.72 and a recall score of 0.74 when applied to a test set of Mediterranean diatom images. Our model performance decreases when used to detect fragments of these microfossils; it also decreases when particles are aggregated or when images are out of focus. Microfossil detection remains high when the model is used on a microscope image set of sediments from a different oceanic basin, demonstrating its potential for application in a wide range of contemporary and paleoenvironmental studies. This automated method provides a valuable tool for analyzing complex samples, particularly for rare species under-represented in training datasets.},

              emissions, provoke ocean warming and acidification1,2, altering
              plankton habitats and threatening calcifying species3,4 such as
              planktonic Foraminifera (PF). Whether they can cope with these
              unprecedented rates of environmental change, through lateral
              migrations and vertical displacements, is unresolved. Here we
              show, using over a century of data from the FORCIS5 global census
              counts, that PF display evident poleward migratory behaviours,
              increasing their diversity at mid to high latitudes, and for some
              symbiont-barren species descending in the water column. Global PF
              abundance decreased by 24.24$\pm$0.11\% over the last decades.
              Beyond lateral migrations6, our study uncovers intricate vertical
              migration patterns among PF species, presenting a nuanced
              understanding of their adaptive strategies. In projected
              temperature and carbonate saturation states for 2050 and 2100,
              low-latitude PF species will face physico-chemical environments
              that surpass their current tolerance. While these species might
              replace high-latitude ones through poleward shifts, this would
              radically alter low-latitude ecosystems. Our insights of PF
              adaptation during the Anthropocene reveals that 'migration is not
              enough', and has broader implications for the evolution of marine
              biodiversity under multiple stressors.},

              relies on tedious manual detection and identification. Most
              recent works on automated pollen analyses have focused on
              classification, while the first step - detection - remains
              overlooked, although critical as detection errors will propagate
              to classification. Detection can be complex when applied on
              real-world samples containing many debris and pollen taxa, and
              pollen that can be damaged or clumped. Here, we used the popular
              algorithm YOLOv5 to evaluate its detection performance on pollen
              slides mounted directly from annual passive traps. We aim to
              provide comprehensive implementation guidelines: share insights
              on how to optimize its use for pollen studies, and how to
              annotate pollen to trade-off labour work and performance. We
              acquired with an automated microscope 1,024 images for each of 16
              samples collected three consecutive years in six locations in
              Southern France. We trained YOLOv5 to detect pollen grains on
              4,098 images containing 12,531 manually tagged and labeled
              grains, while testing for several strategies to build the
              training dataset and annotate the images. We evaluated the
              performance under each strategy, and analyzed the causes of the
              detection errors. We finally tested the most detailed annotation
              strategy for pollen classification on 5 taxa, and validated it
              with manual identification. Only 5.2\% of pollen grains and
              Lycopodium spores (used to calibrate pollen counts) were left
              undetected, and 5.3\% of debris were falsely detected as pollen.
              Undetected pollen grains had rare morphologies, were covered by
              debris, unfocused in the images, or cut in the images. Labeling
              pollen with their taxa did not improve detection, and, tagging
              and labeling one specific taxon decreased the annotation workload
              but was accurate only for morphologically specific taxa. Applying
              the trained YOLOv5 on images from new pollen correlated well with
              counts made by a palynologist. Our results complement pioneer
              studies on automated pollen analyses from real-world samples, as
              they provide common causes for detection errors, and guidelines
              to optimize detection. Automating pollen detection will increase
              the spatial and temporal resolutions of pollen studies.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT The nature and extent of diversity in the plankton has fascinated scientists for over a century. Initially, the discovery of many new species in the remarkably uniform and unstructured pelagic environment appeared to challenge the concept of ecological niches. Later, it became obvious that only a fraction of plankton diversity had been formally described, because plankton assemblages are dominated by understudied eukaryotic lineages with small size that lack clearly distinguishable morphological features. The high diversity of the plankton has been confirmed by comprehensive metabarcoding surveys, but interpretation of the underlying molecular taxonomies is hindered by insufficient integration of genetic diversity with morphological taxonomy and ecological observations. Here we use planktonic foraminifera as a study model and reveal the full extent of their genetic diversity and investigate geographical and ecological patterns in their distribution. To this end, we assembled a global data set of ~7600 ribosomal DNA sequences obtained from morphologically characterised individual foraminifera, established a robust molecular taxonomic framework for the observed diversity, and used it to query a global metabarcoding data set covering ~1700 samples with ~2.48 billion reads. This allowed us to extract and assign 1 million reads, enabling characterisation of the structure of the genetic diversity of the group across ~1100 oceanic stations worldwide. Our sampling revealed the existence of, at most, 94 distinct molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) at a level of divergence indicative of biological species. The genetic diversity only doubles the number of formally described species identified by morphological features. Furthermore, we observed that the allocation of genetic diversity to morphospecies is uneven. Only 16 morphospecies disguise evolutionarily significant genetic diversity, and the proportion of morphospecies that show genetic diversity increases poleward. Finally, we observe that MOTUs have a narrower geographic distribution than morphospecies and that in some cases the MOTUs belonging to the same morphospecies (cryptic species) have different environmental preferences. Overall, our analysis reveals that even in the light of global genetic sampling, planktonic foraminifera diversity is modest and finite. However, the extent and structure of the cryptic diversity reveals that genetic diversification is decoupled from morphological diversification, hinting at different mechanisms acting at different levels of divergence.},

   ABSTRACT={The last glacial inception was characterised by rapid changes in temperature, atmospheric pCO<sub>2</sub>, and changes in the water mass geometry of the major ocean basins. Although several climatic feedback mechanisms have been proposed to explain the glacial/interglacial cycles witnessed in the Quaternary, the exact mechanistic responses of these processes are still under constrained. In this study we use proxies including planktonic foraminifera compositional assemblages and oxygen stable isotopes to reconstruct past changes in sea surface productivity, stratification, and carbonate dissolution. We use core SIS-249 (2,091 mbsl, western South Atlantic 30°S 47°W), spanning 30–110 thousand years ago (ka), and currently bathed by modern Northern Component Water. We test existing hypotheses suggesting that the orbital obliquity cycle modulates the biological pump in the study area. Spectral analysis run on our synthesised productivity proxies recognises a ~43 kyr-cycle, related to the obliquity cycle. We propose that the enhanced productivity is produced by two mechanisms: i) the glacial upwelling of subsurface nutrient-rich waters and, ii) the continental (wind-driven dust and riverine outflows) fertilisation of the photic zone, with the latter process being obliquity-paced. We also suggest that not only the increased organic matter export but also a change in its bioavailability (from refractory to labile) led to calcium carbonate dissolution, as the degradation of the more soluble organic matter decreased the pH of the glacial bottom water, partially dissolving the calcium carbonate. Although our correlation analyses show a strong benthic-pelagic coupling through the relation between the enhanced biological pump and carbonate dissolution (ρ<0.05, r=0.80), we cannot reject the potential of corrosive Southern Component Water bathing the site during the glacial. Finally, we highlight that these processes are not mutually exclusive and that both can be modulated by the obliquity cycle.},

              CO2, and thought to be the major contributing factor for CO2
              drawdown during past glacial periods. Both physical and
              biogeochemical processes control the capacity of carbon storage
              in the ocean. During glacial periods of the Pleistocene the
              larger volume of deep-water masses of Southern Hemisphere origin
              in the Atlantic has been shown to promote carbon storage in the
              Southern Ocean. However, the latitudinal extension of this water
              mass in the Indian Ocean has been scarcely studied. In this
              study, we combine foraminiferal $\epsilon$Nd and benthic
              $\delta$13C of two sediment cores in the southwest Indian Ocean
              (MD96--2077, 33°S, 3781 m water depth; MD96--2052, 19°S, 2627 m
              water depth), to reconstruct the spatial and temporal evolution
              of glacial carbon-rich deep waters in the SW Indian over the last
              630 kyr. The combined use of foraminiferal $\epsilon$Nd and
              benthic $\delta$13C allows to distinguish $\delta$13C changes
              related to water mass mixing and from respired carbon
              accumulation within the water masses. Nutrient-rich deep waters,
              which cannot be explained by the enhanced proportion of
              southern-sourced waters, were present at core sites deeper than
              2700 m during glacial periods and extended at least until 33°S
              into the SW Indian Ocean. From Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 14 to
              MIS 10, glacial carbon storage increased gradually until reaching
              its highest capacity during the extreme glacial periods MIS 12
              and 10. Orbital forcing (100-kyr eccentricity, 41-kyr obliquity),
              restricted air-sea exchange and enhanced ocean stratification,
              fostered higher carbon storage during periods of relatively lower
              eccentricity and obliquity. Furthermore, after MIS 10, a
              progressive transition was observed from 100-kyr eccentricity to
              41-kyr obliquity cycles in benthic $\delta$13C and $\delta$18O
